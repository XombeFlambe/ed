	        				<p class="txt_lg">DiSC is a very simple—and memorable—model made up of four basic styles: D, i, S, and C. Everyone is a blend of all four DiSC styles—usually one, two, or even three styles stand out. Unlike simple personality tests, there is no perfect DiSC style. Since each person has a unique behavioral profile, people are walking around all over the world with different styles and priorities. We believe that these differences are extremely valuable. Once you assess these differences and harness their value, you’ll have better workplace communication AND healthier organizations.</p>
